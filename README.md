 ## Our goal

 In this branch, our main focus will be on **<u>conducting a thorough requirement analysis and creating comprehensive graphical representations for the CET-6 registration system</u>**. We will delve into various aspects of the system, including class diagrams, sequence diagrams, deployment diagrams, and component diagrams. By employing these diverse visualization techniques, we aim to provide a detailed and concrete showcase of the system's functionalities.

  Through requirement analysis, we will meticulously examine and document the specific needs and expectations of the system's stakeholders. This process involves gathering and understanding user requirements, system constraints, and business objectives. By identifying and documenting these requirements, we can ensure that the system is developed to meet the desired goals and specifications.

  In addition to requirement analysis, we will employ graphical representations such as class diagrams to depict the system's structure, relationships between classes, and their attributes and methods. Sequence diagrams will illustrate the interaction and flow of messages between different components or objects during specific scenarios. Deployment diagrams will showcase the physical arrangement and distribution of system components across various hardware and software resources. Component diagrams will provide an overview of the system's high-level components and their interconnections.

  These graphical representations serve as powerful visual aids, enabling stakeholders to gain a clearer understanding of the system's architecture, functionalities, and interactions. They also facilitate effective communication among project team members, aiding in the design, implementation, and testing phases of the development process.

  By focusing on requirement analysis and utilizing various graphical representations, we aim to provide a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the CET-6 registration system, ensuring that the developed system aligns with the stakeholders' expectations and requirements.
